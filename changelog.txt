v.3.1.0
- added ability to pick sensors from GUI interface

v.3.0.4
- more error handling at quit

v.3.0.3
- better handling of SIGINT so service doesn't have to kill the process

v.3.0.2
- rewrote script to be more sane about dealing with Kodi quitting

v.3.0.1
- restructured script for best practice code layout

v.3.0.0
- updates to work in Buster (not backward compatible)

v.2.0.2
- changed location of default config file

v.2.0.1
- if sensor can return pressure trend use that instead of the calculated pressure trend

v.2.0.0
- changes to support Python 3.x
- added support for BME280 Temperature, Humidity, Pressure sensor
- added support for i2c ambient light sensor 
- now communicating data to Kodi via Websockets
- moved fetch of sunrise/sunset times to dedicated setting
- added option to have timed triggers run on weekdays or weekends
- added command line python script to change brightness
- added code to control SenseHat LED to provide some feedback
- pressure trend now calculated in script
- sensor checks and autodim checks now run on separate schedules
- autodim includes three levels: dark, dim, bright
- autodim now sends screen status change notice to Kodi immediately
- autodim only runs if Kodi is running
- SenseHat now returns lower of two temps from pressure and humidity sensors
- sends None to Kodi if sensor does not return data
- added logic to resend JSON call if no response is received from Kodi
- send screen status at websocket connection (so a Kodi restart restores state)
- timed triggered or manual display off cannot be overriden by light levels
  must turn back on manually or with another timed trigger
- removed separate log for sensor data
- functioning systemd service file included
- refactored settings so defaults are stored in code and can be overridden
  (instead of requiring a settings file to be present)
- script tries websocket connection persistently only at first start
- turned debug logging off by default

v.1.0.0
- feature complete
- see README.txt for features and usage details

v.0.4.1
- fix for name change of Kodi addon with which this communicates

v.0.4.0
- gave up on temperature/humidity adjustments and deleted that code
  if you're using a SenseHAT get a ribbon cable and move it away from the CPU
- changed the way the sensor log files are generated to exclude non-responsive sensors
- code refactoring
- auto dimming logic now works
- added min and max light levels in settings to help calibrate camera for particular environs

v.0.3.1
- fixed bug in functions to set brightness (11 is the lowest you can set it)

v.0.3.0
- removed all Joystick interactions (couldn't get the python bindings to respond)
- changed screen off functions to set brightness to 0 instead (so touchscreen stays active)
- responds to message from Kodi to turn brightness back up from 0

v.0.2.0
- added ability to handle websocket messages sent by Kodi (brightness and auto dim)

v.0.1.4
- fix for joystick actions not resulting in anything
- fix for crash if vcgencmd is not found

v.0.1.3
- added temp_factor and humidity_factor to settings to allow calibration of SenseHAT

v.0.1.2
- added testmode setting to generate random data if running on non-RPi platform

v.0.1.1
- substantial refactoring to allow the script to keep logging even if Kodi is not running
- changed the way various threads were handled for simpler logic

v.0.1.0
- name change

v.0.0.10
- added option to have this script trigger the Kodi addon to update the weather screen
- added option to pass extra long joystick holds back to script for special processing
- added beginnings of autodim activation logic
- for testing certain modules return random data if not on RPi

v.0.0.9
- moved all RPi tools into rpiiteract.py
- created new RPi class to get light level from RPi Camera

v.0.0.8
- added command line tool to change RPiTouchscreen state (useful for advanced Cron jobs)
- added logic so script at least runs even without RPi specific libraries

v.0.0.7
- only including settings-example.py. Must rename to settings.py to use script
- made keyboard emulation and rpi-backlight control optional
- updated readme with new instructions

v.0.0.6
- settings.py now required and has all 'default' settings included
- added option to turn RPi touchscreen off and on at given time each day
- code complete but not fully tested with SenseHAT/RPi hardware yet

v.0.0.5
- added keymap options to control brightness and power of RPi touchscreen display
- updated default keymap
- updated settings example to include all options that can be overridden
- still prototype only

v.0.0.4
- added class to convert joystick inputs into keyboard presses
- added class to monitor all sensors
- still prototype only

v.0.0.3
- added temperature adjustment logic if SenseHAT is too close to RPi CPU
- set the script to loop and check sensor every 2 minutes (by default)
- created option to override temp adjustment and change sensor interval in settings
- still prototype only

v.0.0.2
