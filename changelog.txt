- changes to support Python 3.x
- added support for BME280 Temperature, Humidity, Pressure sensor
- added support for i2c ambient light sensor 
- now communicating data to Kodi via Websockets

- autodim only runs if Kodi is running
- SenseHat now returns lower of two temps from pressure and humidity sensors
- sends None to Kodi if sensor does not return data
- added logic to resend JSON call if no response is received from Kodi

- timed triggered or manual display off cannot be overriden by light levels
  must turn back on manually or with another timed trigger

- functioning systemd service file included
- refactored settings so defaults are stored in code and can be overridden
  (instead of requiring a settings file to be present)
- script tries websocket connection persistently only at first start

v.0.4.0
- gave up on temperature/humidity adjustments and deleted that code
  if you're using a SenseHAT get a ribbon cable and move it away from the CPU
- changed the way the sensor log files are generated to exclude non-responsive sensors
- code refactoring
- auto dimming logic now works
- added min and max light levels in settings to help calibrate camera for particular environs

v.0.3.1
- fixed bug in functions to set brightness (11 is the lowest you can set it)

v.0.3.0
- removed all Joystick interactions (couldn't get the python bindings to respond)
- changed screen off functions to set brightness to 0 instead (so touchscreen stays active)
- responds to message from Kodi to turn brightness back up from 0

v.0.2.0

- added option to pass extra long joystick holds back to script for special processing
- added beginnings of autodim activation logic
- for testing certain modules return random data if not on RPi

v.0.0.9
- moved all RPi tools into rpiiteract.py

- updated default keymap
- updated settings example to include all options that can be overridden
- still prototype only

v.0.0.4
